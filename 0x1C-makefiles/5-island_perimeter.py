      • grid is a list of list of integers:
         → 0 represents a water zone
         → 1 represents a land zone
         → One cell is a square with side length 1
         → Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally).
         →  Grid is rectangular, width and height don’t exceed 100
      • Grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is one island (or not
        hing).
      • The island doesn’t have “lakes” (water inside that isn’t connected to
        the water around the island).                                       """
